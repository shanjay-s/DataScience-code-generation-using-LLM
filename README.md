The work aims to address the issue of General Code generation LLMsâ€™ inability to answer practical data science related questions. As a solution to this problem fine-tuning a pretrained code LLM to downstream task of answering data science questions is proposed. This research helps in increase the data science question answering capability of open source LLMs.
